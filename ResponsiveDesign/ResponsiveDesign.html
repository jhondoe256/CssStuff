            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>As mobile devices and tables became widely available, developers had a problem.. how do we create websites that llok good on all screen sizes?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>One Approach</h2>
            <p>Early on, it was common to create seperate stylesheets for different devices, or even completely different websites for each size.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Enter Responsive</h2>
            <p>These days, we typically create ONE website and stylesheet that is able to respons to different device sizes and features.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div>
        <p>The way that we use Responsive Design is via Media Queries</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow us to modify our styles depending on particular parameters like screen width or device type.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
